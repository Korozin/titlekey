# A Title Key Site for Wii U NUS downloaders.
This basically houses all the necessary information for use with a NUS downloader such as FunKiiU or Wii U USB Helper. 

Note: some links are broken as this is done through a secondhand repo and not the .io link directly. ~~If you need to fix a link, like for example downloading a .tik
it will give a link such as: [https://korozin.github.io/ticket/0005000010106b00.tik]  simply change it to  [https://korozin.github.io/titlekey/ticket/0005000010106b00.tik]~~

Fixed ticket download links.
